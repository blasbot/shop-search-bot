'''
shop-bot v1.0
a shopify bot (WIP)
developed by @blasbot

TO-DO
- check if payment was successful or failed
- MAYBE get auth token? doesn't appear to be needed though
- MAYBE get captcha? not sure if needed (create captcha solving module if so)
- add module for sites like KITH and DSMNY which use a different link for
products (https://kith.com/collections/all/products.atom)
- rewrite in C# with a GUI and multi-threading to support multiple tasks at once

EFFICIENCY TO-DO
not insanely effective but it'll help

- preload payment tokens with button click by user (i.e user can click a button
to fetch payment token prior to the drop so resources aren't wasted during tasks
trying to get the token) or get payment token asynchronously
- preload gateways by specifying a sitelist, but also leaving the option for
a user inputted shopify site to ensure as many sites are supported as possible
